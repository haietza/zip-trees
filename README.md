This project is a term paper assignment for CS 5110 Design and Analysis of Algorithms at Appalachian State University. The paper being researched is Zip Trees by Robert E. Tarjan, Caleb C. Levy, and Stephen Timmel https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06726.

The purpose of this repo is to build a zip tree implementation such that its insert, delete, and search functions can be timed against a regular binary search tree and a balanced binary search tree for time comparisons.
